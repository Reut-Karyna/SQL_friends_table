# SQL_friends_table

In this code, you can see my SQL skills, I am demonstrating my ability to create tables, insert data, update records, add columns, and perform basic querying and deletion operations in SQL.

The provided code is an example of SQL statements for creating a table called "friends" and performing various operations such as inserting data, updating records, adding a new column, and deleting records. The code is written in SQL language.
Here's a breakdown of the code:

CREATE TABLE friends: This statement creates a table named "friends" with columns for id (integer), name (text), and birthday (date).
INSERT INTO friends: These statements insert rows of data into the "friends" table, providing values for the id, name, and birthday columns.
UPDATE friends: These statements update specific rows in the "friends" table, modifying the name column for a particular id.
ALTER TABLE friends ADD COLUMN email TEXT: This statement adds a new column named "email" of type TEXT to the "friends" table.
DELETE FROM friends WHERE id = 1: This statement deletes a row from the "friends" table where the id is equal to 1.
SELECT * FROM friends: This statement retrieves all rows and columns from the "friends" table, displaying the resulting data.
